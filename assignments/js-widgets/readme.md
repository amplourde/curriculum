# JS Widgets

Here are a list of little exercises to get you familiar with DOM manipulation
from JS. Try to use as few external libraries as possible (momentjs is OK, if
  you are doing lots of date manipulation).

### Modal

- Remember the modal CSS project you did? Cool.
- Create a page with a button on it.
- When you click the button, show a modal
- When you click the greyed out background, hide the modal
- When you click the [X] close button, hide the modal

### Textarea With Max-length

- Write JavaScript which finds any textareas that have a maxsize attribute:
  (e.g. <textarea maxsize="25"></textarea>)
- Write JavaScript to prevent the user from entering more than maxsize chars
- As the user types, show them how many characters they have remaining

### Auto-Grow Textarea

- Create a textarea that grows (in height) so that it is always bigger than its text content
- Hint: Google to see how this is generally done, but implement it yourself; don't copy/paste

### Dynamic List

- Create a site with a textbox
- When the user enters text into it, add another beneath it
- When the user removes all text from a textbox, and the textbox loses focus, delete the textbox
- There should always be at least one textbox

### Date picker

- Create an awesome date picker (note, this is not as easy as it might sound!)
- Here's some inspiration:

### Drag Elements

- Use mouse events to allow a user to reorder items in a list
- The user should be able to drag an item up or down

### Move Elements

- Build a simple slide-show builder interface
- You should be able to add:
  - a title (big text)
  - a paragraph (small text)
  - any number of images (using URLs, not uploads)
- Rearrange elements by dragging them
- Edit elements by double-clicking them
- [Hard] use the HTML5 file API to allow users to select images from their
hard drive and preview them

### Slide In Side Menu

Go to squarespace and click their nifty menu icon:

See how the menu slides in? Nifty, eh?

Make it so.

### Color Slider

Well, why write it totally from scratch?
