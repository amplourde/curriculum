# Pre-work and resources

None of these are prerequisites for the IronYard's FE course, but having a cursory knowledge of these things should prove useful.

## Learn HTML

There are two ways to start, and which one is "right" depends on how you learn.

If you like to read a bit first, and then tinker, I'd start here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction

If you like to tinker first, and then read, I'd start at Codepen. But first a warning! Codepen HTML snippets are not full HTML documents. Codepen generates the HTML document based on what you type. You are only typing the HTML body content, which is a really good place to start.

OK. So, what do you type in the Codepen window? Have a look at the HTML elements listed here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element

Try typing them into the codepen window and seeing what happens.

If you're confused about an element, Google about it, and keep tinkering.

Here's a more in-depth set of resources:

## Learn Basic CSS

There are lots of CSS tutorials out there. They'll probably teach you pretty bad practices, so I'd recommend sticking to the basics.

Here is a *good* resource:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/What_is_CSS

MDN is generally about as good a resource as you can find online (for free, anyway).

## Copy Someone Else's Work...

If you've gotten this far, I'm impressed.

Now, I'm not saying plagarize, but if you practice your skills by implementing someone elses' design, you'll be doing something very similar to real-world FE work.  

So, it's time to apply what you've learned. Find a cool website and try implementing its layout on your own.

Here's a great design to try:

## Learn a Bit About Fonts

See if you can find good answers to these questions:

1. What's the optimal font-size? Is there one?
2. Is there an optimal ratio between font-size and line-height?
3. Is there an optimal line-length/column-width (hint: sort of)? What is it?

## Learn a Bit About Design

Great start:
http://uxmyths.com/

Here are some books. These aren't technical, so probably won't help you immediately with the IronYard course, but are great resources to help clarify your thinking on design. I'll be bringing these into the IronYard, so look for them there when the cohort starts.

[Don't Make Me Think](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1416519930&sr=8-1&keywords=don%27t+make+me+think)

[Any of Edward Tufte's books](http://www.amazon.com/Envisioning-Information-Edward-R-Tufte/dp/0961392118/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1416519965&sr=8-2&keywords=edward+tufte)

[The Design of Everyday Things](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded-ebook/dp/B00E257T6C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1416520014&sr=8-1&keywords=the+design+of+everyday+things)

## Learn JavaScript

Hey, surprise! I'm linking to another MDN article:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript

In this case, you could use codepen, but I recommend just pulling up your Chrome's console (Ctrl+Shift+J on Windows, Cmd+Opt+J on Mac). You can type simple JavaScript expressions right into that, and see what happens.

If you get through this tutorial, you're off to a great start.


## Other Tutorials

W3Schools also has an introduction to HTML. It's not super slick, and is sometimes dated. But it might prove useful to people who are just starting out.

Here's their CSS tutorial:

Finally, here's their JavaScript resource:
