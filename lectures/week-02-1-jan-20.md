# Week 2, Day 1

## Agenda

Today, we're going to review week 1's concepts, and fill in any CSS/HTML gaps that
remain.

## Topics

- Talk about MVP
- Talk about feature prioritization
- How to think about building a web page
  - Show color schemer and similar tools
  - Fonts sites
  - Image sites
  - Layout sites
- How to style a form
- Transitions & animations
- Q&A on SB site
- Q&A on forms assignment
- Q&A on the memory layout
- Review of terminal, git, and GitHub
- Links (external, relative, and ids)

## Assignment

- Create a project named "portfolio"
- Design your own portfolio website
- It should include:
  - There should be navigational links to take visitors to various parts of the page / site
  - Images of the projects you've done so far, as well as details about them
- You should make use of:
  - At least one background image
  - Colors, borders, margins
  - At least one webfont
- There should be at least 2 pages in your site

Remember to step back and think before diving in.

What do you want this site to say about you?

What action (if any) do you want visitors to take?

What colors do you want in your theme?

Sketch your site on paper or the whiteboard, and use this to identify the major
sections and components of your site. Is there a good name for those sections or
components? (If so, that might make a good class name for your HTML elements.)

Finally, identify your MVP (Minimum Viable Product). What is the minimum amount
of work you need to do in order to ship something of value? (It might just be
a banner with your name and photo.)

*Now* you're ready to start writing some HTML and CSS

First, get your MVP done. When it's done, check it into master, check it into gh-pages, and push both branches up to GitHub.

Then, work on the next most important feature.
