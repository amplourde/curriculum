## Exercise

- Create a basic login form that has inputs styled like this:
  - https://dribbble.com/shots/990899-IOS7-Login-screen/attachments/115966
  - (Don't worry about the icons!)
- Create a site with the following animations:
  - A square that animates up and down (see transform: translateY)
  - A square that animates both up and down and left and right (see transform: translate)
  - A square that spins indefinitely (see transform: rotate)
  - A square that has its background color shifting
  - Play with the animation easing
- Create a square that slides in and stays put when the page loads
  - When the mouse hovers over this, the background color should transition slowly
  to another color
- If you're here, you can go ahead and update your login form to have icons:
  - Use an icon font  http://app.fontastic.me/

## Assignment

- Create a project named "portfolio"
- Design your own portfolio website
- It should include:
  - There should be navigational links to take visitors to various parts of the page / site
  - Images of the projects you've done so far, as well as details about them
- You should make use of:
  - At least one background image
  - Colors, borders, margins
  - At least one webfont
- There should be at least 2 pages in your site

Remember to step back and think before diving in.

What do you want this site to say about you?

What action (if any) do you want visitors to take?

What colors do you want in your theme?

Sketch your site on paper or the whiteboard, and use this to identify the major
sections and components of your site. Is there a good name for those sections or
components? (If so, that might make a good class name for your HTML elements.)

Finally, identify your MVP (Minimum Viable Product). What is the minimum amount
of work you need to do in order to ship something of value? (It might just be
a banner with your name and photo.)

*Now* you're ready to start writing some HTML and CSS

First, get your MVP done. When it's done, check it into master, check it into gh-pages, and push both branches up to GitHub.

Then, work on the next most important feature.
