## Talking points

- Moving items
- Snapping items to a grid
- Reordering a list

## Notes

Once again, we'll be working out of here:

## Assignment

Make a project called: "movable"

Now, you have a choice of what to do. There is a "PowerPoint" option, and
there is a "Reorder" option. You can do one or both of these.

Your choice!

### PowerPoint

Make an editable "powerpoint" slide.

Woah! Sound crazy? Here's what I mean.

Create a page like our move pages from here:

https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-2015/wk5/tree/master/src

It should look something like this:

![Power Point](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-2015/curriculum/raw/master/img/powerpoint.png)

I should be able to click the text or image and move them around.

You should prevent me from dragging the items outside of the bounds of the powerpoint rectangle.

### Hard Mode

When I click the text, show a dialog (or something) that lets me edit the text.

When I click the image, show a dialog (or something) that lets me edit the image URL.

Create a toolbar that allows me to add more text or images to the slide.

### Nightmare Mode

Use localstorage to remember the changes a user makes to a slide

Add/remove slides

....................................

### Reorder

Instead of (or in addition to) the PowerPoint option, create a reorderable
list of items that looks something like this:

![Power Point Reorder](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-2015/curriculum/raw/master/img/powerpoint-reorder.png)

A user should be able to click and drag an item from this list up or down to
reorder the list.

Items should be numbered, and when reordering, you should update item numbers
to reflect their new position(s).
