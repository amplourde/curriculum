Install rails:

Just wanted to get that out of the way, so we have a few days to troubleshoot if
something goes wrong!

### Reorder

In your PowerPoint-like project from yesterday, add a reorderable
list of slides:

![Power Point Reorder](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-2015/curriculum/raw/master/img/powerpoint-reorder.png)

A user should be able to click and drag an item from this list up or down to
reorder the list.

Items should be numbered, and when reordering, you should update item numbers
to reflect their new position(s). (You can't just use ols to do this!)
