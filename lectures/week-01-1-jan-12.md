## Notes

### Syntax
Punctuation matters.

[TShirt](http://www.signals.com/signals/T-Shirts-Sweatshirts-Hoodies_4AA/View-All-T-Shirts-Sweatshirts_4AALL/Item_s-Commas-Save-Lives-Shirts_HN3281.html)

  > Let's eat Grandma. Let's eat, Grandma. Commas save lives.

So does a clear end to your statements.

  > Time flies like an arrow fruit flies like bananas.

  > Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like bananas.

With computers, punctuation and clearly defined statements *really* matter.

Order matters. These are two very diffrent statments:

  > The thing is a soccer ball. The soccer ball is a thing.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all have their own syntaxes

  HTML:

    <tag attrib-name="attrib-value" attrib2-name="attrib-2-value" />
    <tag>Content</tag>
    <!-- comments -->
    <tag attrib-name="you can't put a quote: " in an attribute value">
    <tag attrib-name="you can put an escaped quote: &quot; in an attribute value">


  CSS:

    /* The grammar consists of a selector statement, followed by a block of
    * style properties.
    *
    * Blocks are denoted by an open { and a close }
    *
    * CSS properties are denoted by:
    *  property name
    *  :
    *  property value
    *  ;
    *
    * CSS assignment is a :
    * CSS statement termination is either a ; (for ending property statements)
    * or a } (for ending a block)
    */
    div {
      color: black;
      background: white;
    }

### HTML

* Deals with content
* Processed in order (top to bottom)
*

### CSS

* Selectors
* Colors
* Fonts
* Borders (like a frame)
* Padding (like matting)
* Sizing (px, em, rem, %)
* Margin (the space between elements)
* Background
* Positioning

Colors. CSS colors are usually defined using hexadecimal (base 16) color notation:

    // Syntax is # defines the beginning of a color
    // The first 2 digits define the value of red
    // The next 2 digits define the value of green
    // The last 2 digits define the value of blue

    #FF0000; // red
    #00FF00; // green
    #0000FF; // blue

    // The shorthand notation uses only three digits:

    #F00; // red
    #0F0; // green
    #00F; // blue

Hexadecimal (or base 16) is really pretty easy. It's a way of defining the value
0-15 using only one character (instead of the 2 that would be required in base
10.) 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

So, FF is 255.

Any color (red, green, or blue) can have a value from 0 (0 = black) to FF (255 =
full-strength).

More recent browsers also support rgba and hsla. Look em up. They're swell.

## HREF vs SRC

Href is used to point to resources that are related to a document. SRC is used
to point to a resource that should at as a replacement for the element on which
it is an attribute.


## Exercises

### Basic Text Layout

Using jsbin, create a blog layout. Blog posts have a header, multiple paragraphs, and
an image or two. (You can download some from [pexels](http://www.pexels.com/).)
Content should be centered on screen, but text should be left-aligned.

Grab your text from here: http://meettheipsums.com/

Play with color, if you want: [here's a color guide from Google](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette)

Remember:

- line-length should not exceed 70 characters
- line-height should be proportional to the font-size
- blocks should have extra space (usually a blank line) between them

### Positioning

When you're flying around the world, you often see a map that shows where your
plane is relative to the planet. In this exercise, you're going to do that
using CSS and HTML.

The plane image is: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Aircraft_silhouette.svg/80px-Aircraft_silhouette.svg.png

The map image is: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Eckert4.jpg/1024px-Eckert4.jpg

Using CSS positioning, put the plane somewhere over florida.

Next, allow the world map to resize with the width of the browser, and make sure
the plane remains over florida, even when the map size changes.


## Assignment

Implement this layout: http://academy.smashingboxes.com/

Don't worry about the animations, hover effects, forms, etc.

  - First, grab resources (images)
  - Implement the big, block layout
  - Implement your basic defaults: colors, fonts, h1, p, a styles, etc
  - Implement the page header details
  - Implement the page "hero" block details
  - etc.
