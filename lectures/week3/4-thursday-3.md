## Assignment

### Reading

I never discussed these in class, because I didn't think we'd have the time,
and I personally find them marginally useful, however, you *will* see these
in production and in the real world. So spend 15-30 mins reading/playing
with them:

Read about/play with while loops:
http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_while.asp

Read about/play with switches:

### Work
