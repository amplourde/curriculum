# Week 3 - Thursday

## Topics

Today, we're going to talk about testing... and generally doing
some review and catchup!

## Agenda

- Expecations moving forward...
  - I expect a repo
  - I expect a gh-pages branch
  - I expect an index.html file
  - If it's not working, that's OK. I want to see something and be able to review everyone's code.

- Lecture 1: Testing
  - What is testing?
  - Why do it?
  - Introduce qUnit
  - Write tests for the countdown project

- Exercise

- Lecture 2:
  - Week in review
  - Might want to change git's default editor:
    git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"

## Exercise

- Get some of the unit tests (from the assignment) passing

## Assignment

### Reading

I never discussed these in class, because I didn't think we'd have the time,
and I personally find them marginally useful, however, you *will* see these
in production and in the real world. So spend 15-30 mins reading/playing
with them:

Read about/play with while loops:

Read about/play with switches:

### Work

- Implement this super sweet project:
