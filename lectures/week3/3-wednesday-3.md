## Assignment

### Reading

First, use Google to look up these array methods: (e.g. search for "mdn array sort" and read about that method) 

- join
- push (append value)
- pop (remove last)
- reverse
- shift (remove first)
- unshift (prepend value)
- sort
- splice (remove a chunk of an array, and optionally bulk-insert)
- concat
- slice (extracts a sub-array, given no params, produces a copy)
- indexOf
- lastIndexOf
- forEach
- every
- some
- filter
- map

- Read this: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript

### Work

### Normal mode

- Choose a couple more exercises found here:

Note, if you are shaky with the DOM or with manipulation, you may want to do
a handful of those exercises per week (or invent similar ones) until you are
more familiar!


### Hard mode
- Finish your hexclock, if you haven't already!
